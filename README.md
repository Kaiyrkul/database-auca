Official Report on Database Lab Assignments

Complete execution of all planned practical and laboratory assignments for the AUCA Database course.

The progress for each lab is fully documented, including all console commands and output, within the .txt files.

For technical inspection, all core database operations—including table creation, data manipulation, advanced queries, and transaction demos—are provided as executable .sql scripts. A full database backup (database_backup.sql) is also included.
